All my life I've been playing computer games.
Well, I'd like to work at a company that develops computer games. There are many companies that do this, but I would like to work at Valve. It's an American company with a long history that covers the entire market for the gaming industry. I use their product today. And when I play another one of their games, a lot of ideas come to me about how to make it the best for the player.
The company provides very good conditions for employees. 

One of the advantages of the company is that you can do whatever you want, and there's no organizational hierarchy that many people are used to, no bosses, no subordinates, and even no positions at Valve Corporation. Sometimes Valve employees come up with the name of their position so they can write it on their business card, because many people can't take a professional seriously without a position.


The more interesting and unusual the employee's past, the better. That's why the company has a former actress of children's puppet theater, the creators of a satirical site about video games, a developer of special effects for the film "Lord of the Rings", an artist who draws cool graffiti. And there are a lot of such people in the company. To get a job at Valve Corporation, you don't have to be a video game developer, but you have to be interesting and creative.

And at Valve Corporation, you don't have to work with any intermediaries. All shares in the company are owned exclusively by its employees. And it's unlikely that they'll ever appear on the stock exchanges. So to have anything to do with Valve Corporation, you have to be part of it. There's no other way to do it.
I want to improve this file !!!!
